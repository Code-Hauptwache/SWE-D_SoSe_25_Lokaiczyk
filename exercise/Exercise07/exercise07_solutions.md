# Exercise 07 Solutions

## Task 01: Mainframe vs Cloud Computing

### Key Differences

**Mainframe Computing**
- Centralized Architecture: All processing power concentrated in a single, powerful machine
- High Reliability: Built for 99.999% uptime (five nines)
- Vertical Scaling: Scale by adding more resources to the same machine
- High Initial Cost: Significant upfront investment
- Specialized Skills: Requires specific mainframe expertise (COBOL, JCL, etc.)

**Cloud Computing**
- Distributed Architecture: Processing distributed across multiple servers
- Elastic Scalability: Scale horizontally by adding more instances
- Pay-as-you-go Model: Lower initial costs, operational expenses based on usage
- High Availability: Achieved through redundancy and geographic distribution
- Modern Technology Stack: Uses contemporary programming languages and tools

## Task 02: Cloud Computing Advantages

### Main Benefits
1. **Cost Efficiency** - No upfront hardware investment, pay only for resources used
2. **Scalability** - Instant scaling up or down, handle traffic spikes automatically
3. **Flexibility** - Access from anywhere, support for remote work
4. **Reliability** - Built-in redundancy, automatic backups, disaster recovery
5. **Innovation** - Access to latest technologies (AI/ML, IoT, Analytics)

## Task 03: Cloud Architecture Patterns

### Common Patterns

**1. Microservices Architecture**
- Small, independent services
- Each service handles specific business function
- Communicate via APIs

**2. Serverless Architecture**
- No server management required
- Functions as a Service (FaaS)
- Pay per execution

**3. Multi-tier Architecture**
- Presentation tier (UI)
- Application tier (business logic)
- Data tier (database)

**4. Event-Driven Architecture**
- Components communicate through events
- Loose coupling between services
- Asynchronous processing

## Task 04: When AI Coding Assistants Fail

### Common Failure Scenarios

1. **Context Misunderstanding** - AI misinterprets requirements or ignores project conventions
2. **Complex Business Logic** - Struggles with domain-specific rules and edge cases
3. **Security Vulnerabilities** - May suggest insecure patterns or ignore authentication needs
4. **Performance Issues** - Generates inefficient algorithms or unnecessary database queries
5. **Outdated Practices** - Suggests deprecated methods or old library versions

### Mitigation Strategies
- Always review AI-generated code
- Test thoroughly, especially edge cases
- Verify security implications
- Consider performance impact
