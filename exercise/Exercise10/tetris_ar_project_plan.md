# Tetris AR App Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Tetris game for AR glasses. The application will transform the classic 2D Tetris experience into an immersive 3D augmented reality game where blocks appear in the user's physical space. The game will utilize gesture controls and head movements for gameplay, targeting AR early adopters and casual gamers. Development will focus on core Tetris mechanics, AR integration, intuitive controls, and basic multiplayer functionality, with a 6-month development timeline.

# Task 2: Cost Estimation and Pricing Strategy

## Project Cost Estimation

### Development Costs
| Phase | Team Size | Duration | Person-Months | Cost (€5,000/month) |
|-------|-----------|----------|--------------|---------------------|
| Requirements | 2 | 1 month | 2 | €10,000 |
| Design | 3 | 1.5 months | 4.5 | €22,500 |
| Development | 4 | 3 months | 12 | €60,000 |
| Testing | 3 | 2.5 months | 7.5 | €37,500 |
| Deployment | 2 | 1 month | 2 | €10,000 |
| **Total Personnel** | | | **28** | **€140,000** |

### Additional Costs
- AR Development Hardware: €9,000
- Software Licenses: €5,000
- Marketing Campaign: €50,000
- Overhead (50%): €70,000

### Total Project Cost
**€274,000**

## Pricing Strategy: Free-to-Play with Microtransactions

I would implement a free-to-play model with in-app purchases for the Tetris AR app. This approach offers the highest revenue potential for this type of game.

### Monetization Elements
- **Cosmetic Items**: Custom block skins, environments (€1.99-4.99)
- **Gameplay Enhancements**: Power-ups, game modes (€0.99-5.99)
- **Rewarded Advertising**: Watch optional ads to earn in-game currency or power-ups
- **In-game Advertising**: Banner and interstitial ads for non-paying users

### User Acquisition Strategy
- Launch marketing campaign: €50,000 (app store optimization, digital advertising, influencer partnerships)
- Target 500,000 downloads within first 3 months
- Conversion rate: 3% paying users = 15,000 paying users
- Average revenue per paying user: €20/year = €300,000/year
- Ad revenue from non-paying users: €0.50/user/year = €242,500/year
- Estimated first-year revenue: €542,500

# Task 3: Staffing for Minimal Time to Market

## Core Team Structure (8 members)
- 1 Project Manager (coordinates, removes obstacles)
- 2 AR Specialists (AR implementation, spatial mapping)
- 2 Game Developers (core Tetris mechanics, UI)
- 1 UX Designer (AR interface design)
- 1 QA Specialist (continuous testing)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (build pipeline, deployment)

## Phase-Specific Staffing Allocation
- **Requirements Phase**: Project Manager + UX Designer (2)
- **Design Phase**: Project Manager + UX Designer + 1 AR Specialist (3)
- **Development Phase**: 2 AR Specialists + 2 Game Developers (4)
- **Testing Phase**: QA Specialist + 1 Game Developer + 1 AR Specialist (3)
- **Deployment Phase**: DevOps Engineer + Project Manager (2)

## Personality Balance
- Mix of task-oriented (developers), self-oriented (PM), and interaction-oriented (UX, QA) team members
- Prevents single-focus issues like "everyone wants to do their own thing" or "too much chatting"

## Organizational Approach
- Informal agile structure with minimal hierarchy
- Daily standups and weekly demos
- Tasks assigned based on expertise but with cross-training
- Co-located workspace for quick problem-solving

## Motivation Strategy
- Technical challenge of AR development (task-oriented)
- Clear milestones with celebrations (self-oriented)
- Team activities and collaborative environment (interaction-oriented)

## Time-to-Market Accelerators
1. Parallel development (AR integration alongside game mechanics)
2. Early working prototypes for continuous testing
3. Feature prioritization based on MVP approach
4. Cross-training to prevent bottlenecks
5. Shared code ownership for faster issue resolution

# Task 4: Software Development Process

## Agile (Scrum)

I would use Agile with Scrum for the Tetris AR app because:

1. **Adaptability**: AR technology is evolving rapidly; Agile allows us to adjust requirements as we learn

2. **Informal structure**: As noted in the lecture slides, Agile promotes open information exchange through informal team organization

3. **Early feedback**: Regular 2-week sprints produce playable prototypes quickly, essential for testing AR interactions

4. **Risk management**: Frequent demos help identify technical AR challenges early

5. **Team motivation**: Sprint goals and incremental progress keep the team engaged and focused
