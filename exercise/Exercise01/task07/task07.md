# Task 7: Why Software Design is Necessary

## Why is Software Design Necessary?

1. **Prevents mistakes** - Plan before coding to avoid big errors
2. **Saves time and money** - Fix problems on paper, not in code
3. **Team coordination** - Everyone knows what to build
4. **Easy maintenance** - Well-designed software is easier to fix and update

## Project Without Design?

**Example:** Building a house without blueprints

**What happens:**
- Workers don't know where to put walls
- Plumbing and electricity don't fit
- Rooms are wrong size
- House might collapse
- Waste time and materials

## Consequences of No Software Design:

- **Code is messy** - Hard to understand and change
- **Features don't work together** - Parts conflict with each other
- **Takes much longer** - Keep fixing and rewriting
- **Costs more money** - Waste time on wrong solutions
- **Team confusion** - Everyone builds different things
- **Software breaks easily** - No proper structure

## Conclusion:

Software design is like blueprints for a house. Without it, you build something that doesn't work properly and costs too much to fix.
