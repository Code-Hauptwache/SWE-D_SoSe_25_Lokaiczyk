# Task 6: Software Design vs Software Analysis

## What is Software Design?

Software design is **planning how to build software**. It decides:
- How the software parts work together
- What the structure looks like
- How data flows through the system

## How is Software Design Different from Software Analysis?

| Software Analysis | Software Design |
|------------------|-----------------|
| **WHAT** should the software do? | **HOW** should we build it? |
| Finds requirements and problems | Creates solutions and structure |
| Understands user needs | Plans the implementation |
| "We need a login system" | "Login will use database + encryption" |

## Simple Example:

**Analysis:** "Users want to save their files online"
**Design:** "We will use cloud storage with REST API and user authentication"

Analysis finds the problem, Design creates the solution.
